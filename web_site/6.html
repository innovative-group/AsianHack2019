            Digital farming is applying precision location methods and decision quality agronomic information to illuminate, predict, and affect the continuum of cultivation issues across the farm. Here is a look at each part of the definition:<br> Precision is about geo-location services associated with the Global Positioning System and its extensions. It is the overlay of these geo-location services on a digital map for precision sensing, identification, predictive decision making, and action. Decision quality information is timely and within the decision loop of the event. It is delivered by advanced sensors, descriptive models, and predictive algorithms that provide the required insight to the agronomic issue.<br> Cultivation is a beginning to end, an end-to-end, real-time, continuous, decision process that requires timely decisions and actions. It extends upstream of planting and downstream of harvest. Today, cultivation is about the knowledgeable but subjective observational powers of the individual. Tomorrow it will be about the sensed, objective, predictive power, and precision of the digital ecosystem.<br> Digital farming must also be about an operational system. For this reason, the following requirements ensure the system will scale to millions of acres, deploy across multiple crops, provide an end-to-end solution, exist within an ecosystem, and support the diverse agronomic and economic needs of hundreds, even thousands, of stakeholders at the same time. In a rather crude summary, it must be more than a curiosity for the sophisticated geek and must consistently serve the small grower all the way up to the largest.<br> Digital farming, at the next lowest level, must organize, analyze, and orchestrate the timely delivery of information from the bodies of data that constitute a field. It must be about breaking the field down into differentiable, geo-located, and individually homogeneous units of productive assets. This requirement is about each unit as a productive asset. Precision location ensures that information collected about that unit is measured, collected, analyzed, and actioned for the same location and is differentiated from all of the other surrounding assets. It is about being individually homogeneous and identical in size, its footprint and depth, so that the system can repeatably analyze the same unit. This means that across the footprint and at depth each variable for a productive unit will have the same variable value.<br>
